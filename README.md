# Student Groups Randomizer

This project aims to ease the task of creating random groups of students, whenever necessary.

## Features:

- Add each student's name individually or every student's name separated by a comma;
- Display a list of all the students added, to check for any mistakes;
- Create & display the created groups, allowing the user to copy the groups to the clipboard;
- Save the created class for the next visit! No need to add each student individually again! 🎉

## Tools used:

- Svelte + ViteJS
